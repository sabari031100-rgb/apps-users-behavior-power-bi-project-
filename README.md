This project focuses on analyzing app user behavior through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and modeled to ensure accuracy before applying DAX calculations and visualization techniques. The dashboard highlights important metrics such as daily active users, retention rates, session duration, and feature usage patterns. By exploring these insights, the project demonstrates how user engagement evolves over time and provides a clear understanding of which features drive the most activity. This analysis showcases the capability of Power BI to convert raw data into meaningful insights that can support product improvements, user retention strategies, and overall business growth.
